// HostConnection handles bidirectional communication with host services.
// Plugin implementations should implement this interface if they need
// to call back to the host for privileged operations or shared services.
//
// This interface separates infrastructure concerns (connection management)
// from business logic, making it optional for plugins that don't require
// host services.

// This is typically implemented by the host-side plugin client wrapper (e.g., GRPCClient).

// EstablishHostServices handles the complete setup flow for connecting a plugin to host services.
// It encapsulates the following steps:
// 1. Checks if plugin supports host service registration (via HostServiceRegistrar)
// 2. Registers the host service with the broker and gets a service ID
// 3. Notifies the plugin of the service ID (via HostConnection.EstablishHostServices)
//
// This function gracefully handles plugins that don't support host services.
//
// Parameters:
//   - pluginClient: The dispensed plugin client (typically from rpcClient.Dispense())
//   - hostServices: The host service implementation to expose to the plugin
//   - logger: Logger for status messages
//
// Returns an error if registration fails. Returns nil if plugin doesn't support
// host services (this is not considered an error).
